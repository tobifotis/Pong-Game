# Pong-Game

A classic Pong game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library.

## Project Description

This project is a recreation of the classic Pong game, built using Python's Turtle graphics library. Players control two paddles to keep the ball in play and score points when the opponent misses the ball. The game includes a visual scoreboard and a midline for reference.

## Features

- **Two-player control:** One player uses the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys, while the other uses the "W" and "S" keys.
- **Ball physics:** The ball bounces off the paddles and walls, and its speed increases with each paddle hit.
- **Scorekeeping:** The game keeps track of the score for both players.
- **Midline:** A visual midline to separate the two halves of the screen.
